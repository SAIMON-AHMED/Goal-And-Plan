                    <h2>Who gave me this belief?</h2>

                <div>
                    <p>Belief-the inner strength to do something. But where we get this belief? It comes from my creator. When I pray with conviction I find the strength to keep moving with courage and hope. I become optimistic about my future when I pray to my creator.</p>
                    <p>But is belief can take you so far? I have no "Yes"/"No" answer for this question because it requires an explanatory answer. When start working hard with the name of your creator and keep remembering Him throughout your journey, you find a strength inside you but if don't work hard and just keep praying, you don't find true strength inside you, you feel like you are missing something. What actually you are missing? You are missing the guidance that Allah gave you, you are walking in a way that is not shown by our Prophet(PBUH). And if you are just working hard and do not pray again you are in wrong route because you are not asking help from the biggest source you could get it - your creator. And eventually you get frustrated many times in your journey and sometimes you feel you are giving up. So, you need to work hard and keep asking Allah for helping you.</p>
